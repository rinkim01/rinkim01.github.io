            <h1 class="page-title">Week 4</h1>
            <p>The final week aimed to integrate the permanent electronics with the hockey stick and transition our data
                system into a high-performance, real-time IoT platform. We sought to evaluate the mechanical balance of
                the stick and resolve final power delivery challenges to ensure a seamless user experience.

            <h2>Software</h2>
            <p>Our final software milestone focused on transforming the project into a connected device by implementing real-time telemetry and advanced data filtering. </p>

                    <p>Our project reached its zenith with the deployment of a real-time IoT telemetry platform,
                        connecting the Pico and our laptops via a smartphone hotspot. We configured the Pico to host a
                        non-blocking socket, broadcasting sensor data as JSON strings to a custom web dashboard. We also
                        added a firmware filter to discard signal noise, ensuring the live graphs displayed 100%
                        accurate speed and distance metrics.

            <h2>Hardware</h2>
            <p> Our final hardware tasks focused on the mechanical mounting of the system to the hockey stick and optimizing power management for sustained field use.</p>

                    <p> We finalized the apparatus by mounting the power generator and circuitry onto the hockey stick.
                        The swinging motion of the stick successfully generated electrical energy, proving the core
                        concept of our kinetic harvester. To ensure uninterrupted performance during intensive sessions,
                        we proactively decided to utilize a power bank as a reliable backup energy source. </p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p> We securely attached the fully assembled PCB to the hockey stick. After initial testing for
                        balance, we optimized the mounting position lower and closer to the stick's surface to maximize
                        mechanical stability and handling. This final integration confirmed that our Smart Hockey Stick
                        was not only a technical success but also a viable, balanced tool for athletes, capable of
                        delivering live performance analytics directly from the ice.
