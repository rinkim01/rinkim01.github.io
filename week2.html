            <p>During the second week, the project transitioned from individual component testing to integrated system
                development. The aim was to stabilize the power output for electronic consistency and to successfully
                interface the accelerometer and GPS modules simultaneously to record a comprehensive dataset.
            </p>

            <h2>Software</h2>
            <p>Following the successful completion of the GPS and accelerometer modules, we focused on software
                integration. The Raspberry Pi Pico was programmed to read data from both modules.</p>

                    <p>Following a brief simulation test, we confirmed that the Raspberry Pi Pico was able to
                        successfully read and process data from both the GPS and accelerometer modules. The results
                        obtained from the accelerometer were reasonable and within expected ranges however, the GPS was
                        not picking up any signal which was attributed to the indoor environment.</p>

                    <p>To make the generated power usable for electronics, the coil was connected to a rectifier bridge
                        to convert AC voltage to DC voltage. Because the resulting DC voltage was unstable and
                        insufficient, a supercapacitor and an MT3608 boost converter were added to the circuit. The team
                        discovered the boost converter required approximately 20 full anticlockwise turns to begin
                        stepping up the voltage. It was noted that the high capacitance meant it took roughly ten
                        minutes to charge the system to the required 3.3V.</p>

                    <p>The MPU6050 accelerometer was integrated via I2C at 400 kHz, although initial detection failed
                        due to the Pico being improperly seated on the breadboard. During testing, the original GPS
                        module overheated and failed, requiring a replacement with a backup module. By the end of the
                        week, we had verified a combined script that successfully logged latitude, longitude, speed in
                        m/s, 3-axis acceleration, and calculated total distance.
