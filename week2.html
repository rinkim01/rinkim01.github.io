            <p>During the second week, the project transitioned from individual component testing to integrated system
                development. The aim was to stabilize the power output for electronic consistency and to successfully
                interface the accelerometer and GPS modules simultaneously to record a comprehensive dataset.

            <h2>Software</h2>
            <p>This week’s software efforts were dedicated to refining our data parsing logic to handle real-world
                sensor outputs and launching our project's public-facing digital presence.</p>

                    <p>We implemented a critical firmware update after discovering our logging script was ignoring data
                        from the modern dual-constellation GPS module, which utilized "$GNRMC" headers instead of the
                        "$GPRMC" headers our code was originally expecting. We modified the code to catch both string
                        types to ensure zero data loss and confirmed that the sensors were outputting reasonable values
                        once physical connections were secured. Additionally, we successfully launched the first draft
                        of our project’s web dashboard using HTML and CSS, providing a professional interface for future
                        data visualization.

                    <p>To make the generated power usable for electronics, the coil was connected to a rectifier bridge
                        to convert AC voltage to DC voltage. Because the resulting DC voltage was unstable and
                        insufficient, a supercapacitor and an MT3608 boost converter were added to the circuit. We also
                        successfully optimized the MT3608 boost converter discovering it required approximately 15-20
                        full anticlockwise turns to begin
                        stepping up the voltage. It was noted that the high capacitance of the supercapacitor meant it
                        took roughly ten minutes to charge the system to the required 3.3V.</p>

                    <p>The MPU6050 accelerometer was integrated via I2C at 400 kHz. After troubleshooting the Pico's breadboard seating issues to ensure stable power delivery, we deployed a backup GPS module to maintain momentum after the original unit overheated. By the end of the week, our dual-sensor integration was confirmed with a combined script successfully logging speed, distance, and 3-axis motion in real-time. </p>
